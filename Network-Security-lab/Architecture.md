# Network-Security-Lab

## Building Your Home Lab
Building a homelab is an invaluable step towards becoming a well-rounded and proficient cybersecurity expert

The cybersecurity field is constantly evolving and there is alaways something to learn. A home-lab will serve as a hub for continuous learning and skill development. As you 
progress, you can add new tools 

## The Network Topology
In a home lab, Choosing is the right network topology is Crucial as it determines how data flows and how it communicate. The toplogy impact the lab's efficiency Scalability 
and resilience, playing a key role in creating a realisitic enivromrnt for testing , learning and simualating various network scenarios

A Network topology refers to the arrangement or a layout of devices and connections in a computer networks

## Tools Needed
1. Pfsense
2. Ubuntu
3. S.I.E.M - Spunk, Wazuh
4. Kali
5. Windows Server
6. Windows 10
7. WireSharks
8. Vulunerable Machine
9. Nessus or OpenVG

1. Firewall: This will act as a barrier between different network segments within the topology, controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic.The aim is to
   enhance security by preventing unauthorized access and isolating network components.
2. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Our SIEM here will collect and analyze log data from various systems across the network. In our lab, it will aid
   in real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response, contributing to a proactive security stance.
3. Wireshark: Is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects data traveling back and forth on a network in real-time. Itâ€™s instrumental in understanding
   network behavior, diagnosing issues, and identifying potential security threats through packet analysis.
4. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): AD DS provides a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism. It simplifies network management by organizing
   and managing user resources, contributing to a secure and organized network structure.
5. Vulnerable Machine (optional): A purposely vulnerable machine in our lab would serve as a controlled environment for security testing. This will allows us to practice
   by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities safely.
6. Attack Machine: This will be our dedicated system for simulating various cyber-attacks. It will provide a hands-on platform for learners to understand offensive tactics
   and learn how to defend against them, thereby enhancing our overall cybersecurity skills.
7. SPAN Port: This is configured to duplicate traffic from other ports to one specific port. In our lab, it going to enhance network visibility by allowing Wireshark to
   capture a copy of all network packets for analysis. This aids in monitoring and detecting unusual or malicious activities on the network.
